                <p>My interest in electronics began in my first year of engineering when my cousin <a

                    introduced

                    built
                    finally start to function is truly unique. This served as my initiation, and thanks to his guidance,
                    I
                    embarked on numerous additional projects within the realm of electronics. This experience bolstered
                    my
                    confidence and helped me understand the essential elements required to execute a successful project.

                I had the privilege of attending a talk given by the Nobel laureate himself, Prof. Serge Haroche. His
                talk was on the “History of Science of Light”.
                <br>
                Talks of this nature cultivate a keen interest in Quantum technology.
